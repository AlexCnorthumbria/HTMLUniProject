<p align="center">When it comes to jobs within this field most involve protection of systems or building applications to protect others against malicious attacks</p>
<p align="center">A good example of this is engineers and programmers. These two roles are extremely important to cyber security as they create programs or physical aspects of servers that protect both server based data but also personal computer data. The things they may program are antiviruses, virus detection software and even tools for testing for potential weaknesses within other forms of protection. These roles are normally done by many people in a team managed by ones person as this allows for a focused effort when time sensitive issues arrise but addionally an organized but wider reach for multiple issues at once.</p>
<p align="center">Another job role that is common is freelance hackers. These are white hat hackers who are hired and then authorized by multiple companies to test and hack their systems. This role is quite important to companies because unlike hackers who work for the company directly, these outside hackers do not know the system well or its weaknesses and can offer a new insight into it</p>
<p align="center">Like the freelance hacker there is the inhouse white hat hacker. These people are hired by the company to both build and test their protection and keep it up to date. This means that companies and groups are able to keep up with the constant advancement in technology that allows new ways for virus payloads or hackers to damage systems. The otherside of this groups job is also to inform the company and its employees on correct practices for precautions against hackers. By having this information being common knowledge it massively limits the risk of normal employees accidently exposing the entire company to a hacker</p>
<p align="center">There are many other jobs in this field that all hold important roles howver the main ones are the previously mentioned aspects</p>
