<p align="center">When it comes to hackers its a diverse group of people. While hackers often are grouped together as a negative influence out to cause harm for others that isn't in fact the case. There are three different recognized groups of hackers which all fall into one sections. While there are definatly more subgroups at the base level all hackers will fall into one of these groups</p>
<table align="center" border="1" bgcolor="grey">
<tr><th>White Hat Hackers</th></tr>
<tr><th>This group are usually authorized personal within companies who are payed to find loopholes or faults in systems and report them to the company. This will be done by using the standard hacking tools and using differnet methods to infect or infiltrate a system. While this class are usually regarded as being authorized personal there is a class known as blue hats who are similar but are not authorized to penetrate systems however often do so without taking information and providing all data back to the company afterwards. While not authorized this hack is done in a legal way following specific rules which means blue hats are still operating within the law. White hats are often at odds with malicious gropus and must out do those groups to protect people safely</th></tr>
</table>
<p></p>
<table align="center" border="1" bgcolor="grey">
<tr><th>Grey Hat Hackers</th></tr>
<tr><th>This group can lean either way towards both white or black leading them to be more unpredictable. They are always unauthorized however depending on the hacker may or may not use their skills to infiltrate systems then use the data for personal gain or feedback to companies about their illegal intrustions. Due to this unpredicability and willingness to illegally penetrate systems even while feeding back to systems they are classified as gray hats and therefore treated similarly to those wishing to cause harm</th></tr>
</table>
<p></p>
<table align="center" border="1" bgcolor="grey">
<tr><th>Black Hat Hackers</th></tr>
<tr><th>These hackers only act with their own personal gain in mind and often target the vulnerable because of this. These are the type that will create viruses to infect system and may even do it for fun rather than personal gain as some have been recorded as finding enjoyment in the damage they cause. Due to this and their constant illegal actions online most goverment groups and companies are constantly watching for them so they may strike back and get these people shut down.</th></tr>
</table>
<p></p>
<table align="center" border="1" bgcolor="grey">
<tr><th>Assorted other types</th></tr>
<tr><th>While there is the main three there are more specific roles like the previously mentioned blue hats as hackers are more of a spectrum of how they act or use their skills. There are those like hacktavists that can act both legally and illegaly to promote their own ideals or changes they believe need implement like regular activists. There are state sponsered hackers who are payed by the goverment that hires them to attack or steal information from other companies or groups. Script Kiddies are often newer programmers who create viruses that could have untold potentioal for destruction without any financial gain behind it.</th></tr>
</table>
<p align="center">Due to the amount of malicious hackers that exist many white hat hackers have developed systems or programs that are designed to help the average person stay safe online and often contribute to courses and training informing others on how to best protect themselves from these groups</p>
