<p align="center">Malware is a general term that engulfs many forms of computer programs that are designed to steal data or wreck havoc on systems</p>
<p align="center">Below you will be able to see a few examples of this</p>
<table align="center" border="1" bgcolor="grey">
<tr><th>Trojan virus</th><th>This virus often acts like another program and thus when only when downloaded and the damage has been caused, do victims of this malware realise what it was</th></tr>
<tr><th>Worm viruses</th><th>Worm viruses spread via systems like emails or local computer networks inwhich they stay hidden inside important system files or similar and duplicate until they have stolen the data they want or have caused severe damage to systems</th></tr>
<tr><th>Keyloggers</th><th>Simple in both design and name this virus tracks inputs from mice or keyboards alongside which apps or websites you use in hopes of stealing passwords</th></tr>
<tr><th>Randsomware</th><th>These viruses, upon infection of a device, lock down key systems and data behind a paywall which if uses want their information or system back undamaged they must pay hackers</th></tr>
<tr><th>RootKits</th><th>This nasty virus will hide itself deep within systems and allow hackers remote access to any files or programs on a system whenever they want without the system owner knowing</th></tr>
<tr><th>Others</th><th>There are many others however the ones before are more common besides a group of viruses that have no monetary or value to the hackers who created them and they are just designed to destroy computers for no reason</th></tr>

<p align="center">As you can see there are many different viruses out in the world with many more created on a daily basis which leaves companies and groups scrambaling to fight them. However since viruses act the same within classifications it is easy to spot and act against virsuses when they are found</p>
<p align="center">We will touch on this in a later page however there are many antiviruses that are out there which are reliable and trust worthy however do research into them as sometimes there are trojans that masquerade as antiviruses</p>
<p align="center">There are many a way of catching a virus. This can be done through simple methods like receiving and opening an email infected with a worm virus, downloading a trojan file after being tricked into it, being hacked and having a virus uploaded onto your system or having a trojan that contains other viruses alongside itself. Due to how easy it is to download a virus there is alot of information and training that is offered in which people are trained to spot suspicious emails or obvious scams that contain viruses. However despite this there are still those who are vulnerable such as children and the elderly, which means many scams that are designed to infect computers use this to their advantage and create fake promotions targeting those groups.</p>
<p align="center">The trick to spotting these viruses are emails that are sent from unrecognized senders and websites that ask you to download exe files or files that can be downloaded on the offical site. A common trojan that targets children is free versions of currently popular video games. This scam works by first creating promotional material thats similar to the original before tricking children into downloading viruses from fake websites</p>
