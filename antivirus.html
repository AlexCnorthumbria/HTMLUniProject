<p align="center">Antiviruses are a common toolkit used by pretty much every modern device. Modern windows devices all come preinstalled with Windows Defender. This is microsofts own created antivirus and while it is useful most people end up replacing it by purchasing a more powerful and more up to date version</p>
<p align="center">While all devices should use antiviruses there are some operating systems that are less at risk than others. Linux based systems and Mac systems are actually at less risk to viruses by a small margin due to most viruses being written for windows and therefore being incompatiable with different operating systems. This means viruses won't work as intented on these operating systems however its is still risky to not get antivirus protection for these systems and therefore it is heavily advised</p>
<p align="center">The main advantages of antiviruses are simple. They offer protection against common virus types and are able to scan properly for them using specific classifications built in to flag suspicious files and behaviours. Alongside this most are kept heavily up to date meaning newer viruses with work arounds do not work for very long.</p>
<p align="center">However, despite the usefulness of the program there are still flaws to it and loopholes that will be used. They not only must be kept up to date but users must keep themselves informed and continue to look for and avoid potential viruses that hackers may use that could bypass these systems</p>
<p align="center">Additionally often times computers and servers and special protections built into themselves which uses passwords to verify certain actions. The antivirus is able to restrict applications from performing certain actions until either the user has given it the thumbs up or the antivirus has fully scanned it. This additional layer of security means unless given permission no dangerous actions can be taken without anyone watching</p>
